Careful with T7 phage because this is very efficient and when used, it can stop
all other functions in the cell. 
Recombinant expression of membrane proteins tend to be toxic. There is a chance
of change in the membrane potential. Use evolutionary engineering to optimize
using toluene as a carbon source. Keep todX as an "add on". Find a way to reach
our goal through different ways and adapt as we go along. There could be many
things that go wrong. The RNA could not be transcribe, the AA is not translated.
You would assay them with PCR to check their quantity for RNA, for protein use
tags to do a western blot to check for their expression. 
It would be really good if we could show that todE and todF works in degrading
3-methylcatechol. Then we can add in the green boxed pathway that is well
studied in literature.
